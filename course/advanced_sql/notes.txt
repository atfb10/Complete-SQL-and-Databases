Group By
    * Summarize or aggregate data by groups
    * Group By splits data into groups so we can apply functions against the group rather than the entire table
    * Split by groups, apply aggregate functions, combines group with single value returned from aggregate function
    * Order of Operations: SELECT -> FROM -> WHERE -> GROUP BY -> HAVING -> ORDER
    * FEYMAN: Group By - groups data by a column, or columns. Then a function is run on another column or columns. The result of the function is matched with the column designated as the group

HAVING
    * Filter by groups
    * Having applies filters to a group as a whole -> Can filter on the output of the aggregate 
    * Can have HAVING and WHERE in same query. HAVING filters on group, WHERE filters on row
    * FEYMAN: Having = allows one to filter by the results of a group by
