Data Models and Naming Conventions
    * Model is a design that is used to visualize what we are going to build
        > Entity Relationship Diagram
    Naming Conventions
        > Table Names: Must be singlular
            # Example: Student
        > Columns: should be lowercase w/ underscores
            # Example: first_name
        
Create Table Syntax:
    CREATE TABLE name (
        col TYPE [CONSTRAINT]
    );

Temporary Table
    * Dropped at end of session
    * Visible only to the creator
    * Why use?
        > If you're writing intensive queries against a data set it might be beneficial to create another table off another table
            # They behave just like normal tables
            # Postgres ally less "rules" (logging, transaction locking, etc.) to temporary tables making them execute more quickly
            # You have full access rights to the data, if you otherwise didn't, so that you can test things out
    * Syntax: CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE name (columns) [INHERITS existing_table];

Constraints - Tool to Apply validation maethods against data that will be inserted
    * Column Constraint - Part of a column definition
        > NOT NULL
        > PRIMARY KEY 
        > UNIQUE 
        > CHECK - Apply a special condition check against the values in the column
        > REFERENCES - Constrain the values of the column to only be values that exist in the column in another table
            # FOREIGN KEY
    
    * Table Constraints - Can encompass more than one column
        > UNIQUE 
        > PRIMARY KEY
        > CHECK - condition to check
        > REFERENCES - FOREIGN KEY relationship to a column
        
        > syntax (put at bottom of create table)
            CONSTRAINT constraint_name TYPE_OF_CONSTRAINT (column or columns being constrained)

        > Every column constraint can be written as a table constraint
        > If constraint encompasses only 1 column, write as column constraint, else consider the table constraint
