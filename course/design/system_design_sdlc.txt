SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle
    1. System Planning & Selection - What do we want?
        > Requirements Analysis
    2. System Analysis - What do we need?
        > Taking in requirements and determining if it can be done on time and on budget
    3. System Design - How do we do it?
        > System architecture
    4. System Implementation & Operation - Use it
        > Build, Test, Use

Top Down
    * Optimal choice when creating a new database
        > You start from 0
        > All requirements all gathered up front
    * GOAL: Create data model based on requirements

Bottom Up
    * There's an existing system or specific data in place
    * Optimal choice when migrating an existing database 

ER Model - Entity Relationship Model (Diagram)
    * It is a diagram that functions as a way to structure high-level relationships
    * Steps
        1. Determine Entities (Tables)
            > What is an entity?
                # Person, place or thing
                # Has a singular name
                # Has an identifier
                # Should contain more than 1 instance of data
        2. Determine Attributes
            > Properties
                # Property of entity
                # Must be atomic
                # Single/multivalued
                # Keys

Relation Schema
    * Representation of data going into table

Relation Instance
    * Data that is to go into the relation instance

Relation Keys
    * Super Key: Any combination of attributes that can uniquely identify a row
    * Candidate Key: Minimal amount of attributes to uniquely identify a row
    * Primary Key: column that uniquely identifies the relationship
    * Foreign Key: References a key from a different table
    * Compound Key: Key that uses multiple columns to uniquely identify a row, and DOES use a foreign key
    * Composite Key: Key that uses multiple columns to uniquely identify a row, but does NOT use a foreign key
    * Surrogate Key: Column that uniquely identifies a row, but has nothing to do with the information of a row.
        # EXAMPLE: UUID

Relationships
    * One to One
    * One to Many
    * Many to Many
