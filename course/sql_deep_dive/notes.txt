SQL is case insenstive if you use ""

SQL Commands

DCL (Data Control Language)
    * Grant 
    * Revoke

DQL (Data Query Language)
    * SELECT

DDL (Data Defination Language)
    * CREATE
    * ALTER
    * DROP 
    * RENAME
    * TRUNCATE
    * COMMENT

DML (Data Modification Language)
    * INSERT
    * UPDATE
    * DELETE
    * MERGE
    * CALL 
    * EXPLAIN PLAN
    * LOCK TABLE

SQL Function - Set of steps that returns a single value
    * Aggregate - Aggregate all data and return single value.
        > AVG()
        > COUNT()
        > MIN()
        > MAX()
        > SUM()
    * Scalar - Run against each row and return output for each row. EXAMPLE. count

Comparison Operators
    * >
    * >=
    * <
    * <=
    * =
    * !=

Operator Precedence (in order)
    1. Parentheses
    2. Arithmetic Operators
    3. Concatenation Operators
    4. Comparison Conditions
    5. IS NULL, LIKE, NOT IN, IN, etc.
    6. NOT 
    7. AND
    8. OR

    * If the operators have equal precedence, then the operators ar evaluated directionally, from left to right or right to left
        > All are left to right except:
            1. addition & subtraction
            2. NOT 
        > When in doubt, use Parentheses!!!
        > Example of Danger: WHERE gender = 'F' AND state = 'OR' OR state = 'NY';
            # THIS WILL return where gender is female and in new york, or anyone who lives in New York.
        > Example of fixed: WHERE gender = 'F' AND (state = 'OR' OR state = 'NY');
            # This will return females from oregon and new york

Empty Values
    * Shows <NULL> or null for empty values
    * By default, fields are nullable
    * Be mindful about what is made nullable
    * NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO WITH NULL, IT WILL ALWAYS BE NULL (subtract, add, concatenation, etc)
    * IS - allows you to filter on values that are null, not null, TRUE or FALSE
    * IMPORTANT: != does not work on null values
    * "coalesce" replaces null values
        > EXAMPLE: SELECT coalesce(<column> 'Empty') as <column_alias> FROM <table>
    * Coalesce returns the first non-null value in a list

Three-Valued Logic
    * Each expression can have 3 values
    * True, False or NULL
    * Null does NOT equal Null (Null is unknown!)
    * Use IS NULL to check if something is null. = Null WILL NOT WORK!!!

IN - Check if value is in list of value

MISC Notes
    * Dates must go in single quotes ''
