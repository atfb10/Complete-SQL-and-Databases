Query = SQL Statement
    - Question we want to ask the databases

Operations 
    * = All
    FROM = this table
    WHERE = conditional filtering

Terms
    - clause: each line
    - identifier: name of table, column, etc
    - expression: meets condition

Imperative vs Declarative
    - Declaritive: What will happen?
    - Imperative: How will it happen?
    - Declarative Example:
        > SQL
    - Imperative Example:
        > Java
    - Both Example:
        > Python

SQL Standards:
    - SQL is highly standardized
    - Committee meets yearly from each major RDBMS company to agree to standards

Model - way data will be structured

Hierarchal Model
    - Store data in tree-like structure 
    - Outdated, because of inefficiency
    - Each child can have multiple children, but only 1 parent (1 to many relationship)
    - When parent deleted, child goes away. Data is highly coupled 

Networking Model
    - Expanded on Hierarchal model; allowing for many-to-many relationships
    - Relationships become complex

Relational Model
    - Relation Schema
    - Attribute > Another name for column
    - Degree > Degree of relation is the collection of columns (name of all the columns)
    - Cardinality > Collection of rows; the collection of all rows in a table
    - Tuple > Another name for row
    - Column > Attribute of a table. Holds specific data for the table object
    - Row > Single representation or "instance" of data for object of table
    - Relation Key
    - Domain (Constraint) > What type of data a column is allowed to store
    - Table > Representation of object
    - Relation Instance

DBMS - Database Management System
    C - Create
    R - Read 
    U - Update 
    D - Delete

RDBMS - Relational Database Management System

Primary Keys
    > Uniquely identifies row in table

Foreign Keys
    > Foreign Key references the primary key of a different table
    > Is a new column in table that manages relationship between two tables

OLTP VS OLAP
    - Online Transactional Processing: Optimized for transactional processing and real-time updates (Supports Day to Day)
    - Online Analytical Processing: Optimized for complex data analysis and reporting (Supports Analysis)
