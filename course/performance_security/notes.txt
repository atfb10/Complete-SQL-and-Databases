Scalability
    * Vertical - Adding more physical hardware to increase capabilities to machine (more RAM, more disc space, etc.)
    * Horizontal - Adding more phyiscal machine to increase capabilities

Sharding
    * Splitting data across multiple datas
    * EX: splitting users up on different databases by alphabetic order (A - J on one machine, K - S on one machine, T - Z on a third machine)

Replication
    * Have db backed up by another db in another location
    * Synchronous - replication occurs at same time
    * Asynchronous - replication occurs at different times 

Backups
    * Similar to replication, but does not occur simulataneously. Occurs at scheduled time; like 1x per night
    * Dump data to SQL file in safe location
