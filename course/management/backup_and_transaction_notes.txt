Planning Macro Steps
    1. Backup Plan
        > Determine what needs to be backed up?
            # Full backup (less often)
            # Incremental - everything that changed since the last incremental backup (or full backup if no incremental yet) (often)
            # Differential - everything that changed since the first full backup (often)
            # Transaction log - backup of data transactions that have occurred (a lot)
        > What's the appropriate way to back up? 
            # backup OS
            # backup DB
            # backup Hard-drives
        > How frequently are you going to back up?
        > Decide where you are going to store backups
        > Have a retention policy for the backup
    2. Disaster Recovery Plan
    3. Test your Plans

What Can Go Wrong?
    1. Hardware failures
    2. Viruses
    3. Power Outages
    4. Hackers
    5. Human Errors

SQL DUMP
    * How to create backups in POSTGRES - SUPER DUPER EASY TO DO IN GUI such as ValentinaStudio
    * pgBackRest
        > Simple and reliable backup solution; 3rd party

Restore Database (Load DUMP)
    * SUPER DUPER EASY TO DO IN GUI such as ValentinaStudio
    * IF fails, use the command line & PSQL

Transaction - Unit of instructions (Query for instance)
    * DBMS Has a mechanism in place to manage transactions
    
    * Steps
    BEGIN; -> begins a transaction 
    <transaction>; -> partially committed, locks resource
    option1 ROLLBACK; -> Uncommit changes
    option2 END; -> commit changes

    * To maintain integrity of db, all transactions must obey acid properties
        > Atomicity: Either execute entirely, or not at all
        > Consistency: Each transaction should leave the database in a consistent state (commit or rollback)
        > Isolation: Transaction should be executed in isolation from other transactions
        > Durability: After completion of a transaction, the changes in the database should persist
