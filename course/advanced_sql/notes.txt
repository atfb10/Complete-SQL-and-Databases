    * Group By splits data into groups so we can apply functions against the group rather than the entire table

    * Order of Operations: FROM -> WHERE -> GROUP BY -> SELECT -> ORDER
    * FEYMAN: Group By - groups data by a column, or columns. Then a function is run on another column or columns. The result of the function is matched with the column designated as the group
